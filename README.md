# narrow-exam-choices
Bookmarklet to remove clutter from the UTD testing center exam registration form.

## How to set up
1. In your favorite web browser, add a new bookmark/favorite.
2. Enter anything you want for the title; I chose "Narrow exam choices".
3. In the URL box, enter `javascript:` followed by the contents of [NarrowExamChoices.min.js](NarrowExamChoices.min.js).
4. Save the bookmarklet.

## How to use
1. Go to the UTD testing center exam registration form and choose your school.
2. Next, you are prompted to choose from 50 bajillion available exams. Rather, click the bookmarklet you made in the previous section.
3. In the prompt, type some text you know will appear in the exam option you're looking for (professor's name, course number, etc).
4. Choose your test from the now significantly shorter list of available exams.
